# react-test

This is my first app with React, it just show a list of "monster" fetched from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com.
The project is divided in a few components just to work arround with them.

If you clone this proyect remember to use the command "npm start" to test the project in a local enviroment and "npm run build" to get the minimized version of it.
